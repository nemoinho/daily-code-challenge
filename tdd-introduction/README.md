# TDD-Introduction

Today we want to strive into test-driven-development. That is probably a long and complex word for many people but it's actually really quick to learn and easy to adopt.

TDD really improves your development-skillz because it give you the opportunity to say what your code does.

You should never have to say again something like »Yah, that shouldn't happen, but I don't know if it's really not be the case«.

## The situation
We have to implement a user-structure. The task is pretty clear and directly described as followed.

We need to have a user with a nickname, it's firstname and it's lastname.
Beside of that we have groups of users which alwas have an admin. The admin is also a user but not necessarily one of the users in the group. Furthermore a user can be a member of many groups and also of no group.

## Overview
This project contains of two similiar implementations of the given situation. One written in JS and another written in PHP.

## Task
The project-initialter had already started the TDD-process by setting up a stub of the given situation. After that he started immediately with implementing the tests, to make sure that his future implementation fullfills the references. But he had to stop working on the project and now you have to write the missing tests.
